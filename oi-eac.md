- [Outlook Integration System Requirements](https://help.salesforce.com/articleView?id=sf.app_for_outlook_system_requirements.htm&type=5)
- For best experience:
    -  we recommend using an Outlook version that supports pinning the Salesforce pane so that it’s always open.
- To run the integration in Outlook, 
    - Each user must have the Salesforce add-in, available in the Microsoft AppSource store. 
    - Your Exchange or Office 365 administrator can install the Outlook integration for all users with Microsoft Centralized Deployment. 
        - Or, if Outlook users can access the store, they can install the integration themselves.
#### Browsers
- Google Chrome™, most recent stable version
- Mozilla® Firefox®, most recent stable version
- Apple® Safari® 10 or later, most recent stable version recommended
- Microsoft Edge, most recent stable version (Windows only)

### Data Storage
- Data is stored on Microsoft servers and Salesforce servers only. 
- If customers upgrade to **Inbox**, some data is stored on Salesforce Amazon Web Service (AWS) servers.
